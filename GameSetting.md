1HP Concept

RPG
Hero has the unique ability to CONSUME enemies, gaining their abilities. (ex: fire resistance, ice blast, telekinesis)
Eating enemies is the only way to gain abilities and the only way to level them up.
NPCs should have interesting dialogue and EXTRA USEFUL SKILLS(that can be CONSUMED without eating the people), but maybe some are good people.
Maybe some are cursed, and the hero CONSUMING the curse is morally good, even though they suffer the consequences.

Everyone and everything in the world is fragile. Like they only have 1HP. But you're different. You have more than that, and it's increasing...
Maybe an rpg where you have the strength to defeat the dangers in the world?
