## **FRAGILE WORLD**
The world is fair but dangerous. Every living being is granted one Health Point and one ability. Taking damage is instant death.  
People were granted diverse abilities, but cursed with fear. Monsters were granted few abilities but feared nothing.
Fearing the Monsters that did not fear for themselves, People formed a town, surrounded themselves with stout walls and guarded gates.  
They never stopped trying. Never thought to give up. But the Monsters could never break through the combined defences of the People.

###### *The Monsters could not enter.*  
###### *The People could not leave.*  

But a Prophet was among the people, a wise individual who knew the stalemate would not last, and that change was inevitable.  
The Prophet foretold a day would come for the walls to fall. Death would abound. The conflict would end. A short period of turmoil before a new order established itself.  
_They did not, however, mention who the outcome would favour._
